# MDA_Heat-Waves
This is the repo for the project of course MDA

The jupyter notebooks in code are organized as follows:
## Section 1: Data collection and cleaning
Weather data collection and cleaning: [weather_data_processing.ipynb](https://github.com/YepLiu/MDA_Heat-waves/blob/main/code/weather_data_processing.ipynb)  
Other data cleaning: [data_cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/YepLiu/MDA_Heat-waves/blob/main/code/data_cleaning.ipynb)
## Section 2: Map visualization
[map_visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/YepLiu/MDA_Heat-waves/blob/main/code/map%20visualization.ipynb)  
## Section 3: Model prediction
Mortality analysis: [regression analysis of mortality.ipynb](https://github.com/YepLiu/MDA_Heat-waves/blob/main/code/regression%20analysis%20of%20mortality.ipynb)  
Heat time-series prediction: [heat_time_series_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/YepLiu/MDA_Heat-waves/blob/main/code/heat_time_series_prediction.ipynb)  
gdp_temperature_prediction: [gdp_temperature_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/YepLiu/MDA_Heat-waves/blob/main/code/gdp_temperature_prediction.ipynb)  


Remark: Most data are provided in [data](https://github.com/YepLiu/MDA_Heat-waves/tree/main/data), the raw data of weather is too huge to upload, the source of the data is mentioned in the report.
